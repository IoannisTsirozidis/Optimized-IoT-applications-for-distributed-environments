# Optimized-IoT-applications-for-distributed-environments

During **Data & Web Science** ( [DATALABS](https://datalab.csd.auth.gr/) ) postgraduates studies competition, with the support of the [RAINBOW](https://rainbow-h2020.eu/) Fog-Computing Platform, our team developed a Fog Computing solution, using Python Automated JSON queries to retrieve specific data from a JavaScript Object Notation document.  

In the evaluation process, our solution was regarded closest to optimal, which gave us 1st place locally in Thessaloniki.
